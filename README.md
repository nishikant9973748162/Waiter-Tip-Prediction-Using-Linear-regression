# Sorting Visualizer

## Project Overview

This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** built to visualize at least 10 different sorting algorithms. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a visual representation of the sorting process. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and can be run directly in a web browser.

## Features

- Visualizes the following sorting algorithms:
  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Selection Sort
  3. Insertion Sort
  4. Merge Sort
  5. Quick Sort
  6. Heap Sort
  7. Radix Sort
  8. Counting Sort
  9. Bucket Sort
  10. Shell Sort
- Ability to control the speed of visualization.
- Adjustable array size to visualize sorting on different data sets.
- Visual feedback during the sorting process (color changes for comparisons and swaps).
- Clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To structure the web page.
- **CSS3**: To style the visualizer and provide an aesthetically pleasing interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To implement the sorting algorithms and control the visualization.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   or simply drag and drop the `index.html` file into your web browser.

3. Select the sorting algorithm, adjust the speed and array size, and click "Start" to see the algorithm in action.

## Usage

1. **Select a Sorting Algorithm**: Choose from one of the 10 available algorithms.
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the slider to control how fast or slow the sorting is visualized.
3. **Adjust Array Size**: Use the slider to control the number of elements in the array.
4. **Shuffle & Reset**: Click the shuffle button to generate a new random array.
5. **Start Sorting**: Click the "Start" button to begin the sorting process.

## Future Enhancements

- Add additional sorting algorithms like Tim Sort, Bitonic Sort, etc.
- Make the UI responsive for mobile devices.
- Add sound effects to enhance user experience.
- Add step-by-step explanation of each algorithm alongside the visualization.
